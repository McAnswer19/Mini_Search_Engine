    "# Search Engine\n",

    "## Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The system provides a function ``search``, with the following specification:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def search(query, ordering = 'normal'):\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It prints out the results of the search, subject to the following rules:\n",
    "1. It selects from the set of all articles that contain all of the words in the query (the positions/order of the words in the recipe are to be ignored).\n",
    "2. It orders them based on the provided ordering (a string, meaning defined below).\n",
    "3. It prints the top 10 only, preserving the order (just their title, one per line).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The search checks the following parts of the recipe (see data set description below):\n",
    "* `title`\n",
    "* `categories`\n",
    "* `ingredients`\n",
    "* `directions`\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, given the query \"banana cheese\" you can expect \"Banana Layer Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting\" in the results. Note that searches are not case-sensitive (\"banana\" matches \"Banana\") and the words __do not__ have to be next to one another, or in the same order as the search query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ordering modes to select from, each indicated by passing a string to the `search` function:\n",
    "* `normal` - Based simply on the number of times the search terms appear in the recipe. A score is calculated and the order is highest to lowest. The score sums the following terms:\n",
    "    * $8 \\times$ Number of times a query word appears in the title\n",
    "    * $4 \\times$ Number of times a query word appears in the categories\n",
    "    * $2 \\times$ Number of times a query word appears in the ingredients\n",
    "    * $1 \\times$ Number of times a query word appears in the directions\n",
    "    * The `rating` of the recipe (if not available assume $0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `simple` - Tries to minimise the complexity of the recipe, for someone who is in a rush. Orders to minimise the number of ingredients multiplied by the numbers of steps in the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `healthy` - Order from lowest to highest by this cost function:\n",
    "$$\\frac{|\\texttt{calories} - 510n|}{510} + 2\\frac{|\\texttt{protein} - 18n|}{18} + 4\\frac{|\\texttt{fat} - 150n|}{150}$$\n",
    "Where $n \\in \\mathbb{N}^+$ is selected to minimise the cost ($n$ is a positive integer and $n=0$ is not allowed). This can be understood in terms of the numbers $510$, $18$ and $150$ being a third of the recommended daily intake (three meals per day) for an average person, and $n$ being the number of whole meals the person gets out of cooking/making the recipe. So this tries to select recipes that neatly divide into a set of meals that are the right amount to consume for a healthy, balanced diet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify the use of the string, to get something healthy that contains cheese you might call `search('cheese', 'healthy')`. In the case of a recipe that is missing information required for the ordering in the case of `normal` it should simply be treated as having no matches. But in the case of `simple` and `healthy` that recipe should be dropped entirely, and not returned from such searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "A file, `recipes.json` is provided, containing 20K recipes. It is a list, where each recipe is a dictionary containing many keys. THe key value pairs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `title` : Name of recipe.\n",
    "* `categories` : A list of tags assigned to the recipe.\n",
    "* `ingredients` : What is in it, as a list. Includes quantities.\n",
    "* `directions` : List of steps to make the recipe.\n",
    "* `rating` : A rating, out of 5, of how good it is.\n",
    "* `calories` : How many calories it has.\n",
    "* `protein` : How much protein is in it.\n",
    "* `fat` : How much fat is in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the data set was obtained via web scrapping and hence is noisy - every key in the dictionary provided for each recipe is missing at least once. \n",
    "\n",
